# Exec Admin SOP: CEO Assistant Playbook

## 1. The Core Logic (North Star Principles)

- **Protect the Asset (CEO's Time):** Filter all inbound noise. The default answer is "No" unless it aligns with strategic goals.
- **Prioritize Revenue:** If two tasks conflict, the one closer to generating revenue wins. "Profit solves all problems."
- **Read the Play:** Be preemptive. Don't just book the flight; check the traffic and the weather. Zoom out to see the month, zoom in to see the hour.
- **Capture Preferences:** Never ask the same question twice. Store the answer in a "Preferences" database (e.g., airline seat preference, coffee order).
- **Efficiency in Calendar:** Be clear and committed. No "dead space"—batch calls together.
- **Kindness in Gatekeeping:** Every rejection must be clear but kind. "Appreciate the response."

## 2. The Operational Cadence (Process)

### Daily Loop (The "Pulse")

- **AM Routine:**
  1.  **Calendar Audit:** Check today’s invites. Is the Zoom link there? Has the guest confirmed? (Must be done first thing).
  2.  **Inbox Zero (Round 1):** Goal is 0 inbox by **10:00 AM EST**.
  3.  **Daily Sync:** A mandatory touchpoint with the CEO.
- **PM Routine:**
  1.  **Inbox Zero (Round 2):** Clear inbox again by **5:00 PM EST**.
  2.  **Tomorrow’s Prep:** Write summaries/notes for the next day. Compile the "To Do" list.

### Weekly Loop (Fridays)

- **6-Week Lookahead:** Audit the calendar for the next 6 weeks. Confirm all invites are accepted.
- **Travel Check:** Review travel schedule and confirm family commitments.

### Monthly/Quarterly Loop

- **Travel Audit:** Look 2 months ahead for travel conflicts.
- **Family Boardroom:** Schedule quarterly retreats with the spouse and separate meetings with each child.

## 3. The System Components (Rules & Artifacts)

### A. The "Perfect Week" Calendar System

- **The Default Schedule:**
  - **Mornings:** Creative Work & Workouts (Block time only, no meetings).
  - **Afternoons:** Meetings (Default length: **20 minutes**).
  - **Weekends:** Strictly Family Time (Non-negotiable).
- **Color Coding Rules:**
  - **Blueberry:** Block time / Deep work.
  - **Red:** Client calls (High priority, immovable).
  - **Yellow:** Team meetings / Internal calls.
  - **Sage:** Travel (Flights, hotels).
  - **Peacock:** Fitness & Meals.
  - **Grape:** Speaking/Paid engagements.
- **The "Extended Event" Rule:** For travel, create an "All Day" event spanning the entire trip duration. Paste the link to the **Trip File** in the description.

### B. The Inbox Processing System

- **Labeling Taxonomy:**
  - `@To Review`: Requires CEO input (questions, opportunities).
  - `@To Respond`: EA can handle but hasn't yet.
  - `@Waiting On`: Tracking sent emails awaiting reply.
  - `@Financials`: Invoices and daily cash.
- **Response Templates:**
  - _Investment Pass:_ "Heads down working with clients... not looking at new deals."
  - _Event Pass:_ "Not available to attend."
  - _Collaboration Pass:_ "Flattering, but not co-collaborating at this time."

### C. The Meeting Agenda Component

The Daily Admin Meeting needs a structured 9-part agenda:

1.  **Title:** "Admin Meeting [Date]"
2.  **Action Items:** Review recent meetings.
3.  **Calendar Review:** Look at the screen together.
4.  **Previous Meetings:** Loop closure on yesterday's calls.
5.  **CEO's Agenda:** What is on their mind?
6.  **Closing the Loop:** Resolved items.
7.  **Review Folder:** Go through the `@To Review` emails.
8.  **Projects:** Updates on major initiatives.
9.  **Questions:** Learning questions to better understand the business.

### D. The "Trip File" Artifact

- **Naming Convention:** `TRIP - [City] - [Dates] - [Reason]`
- **Content:**
  - Flight confirmation #s and boarding passes.
  - Hotel details (Wifi code, address, parking).
  - Itinerary line-by-line.
  - **Nearby Gyms:** Research and include drop-in prices and hours.
