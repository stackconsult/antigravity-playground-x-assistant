## 🌌 Philosophy

The **Antigravity Framework** is a deterministic state-machine protocol designed to eliminate the "hallucination spiral" in AI coding agents. By enforcing a rigid, predictable filesystem ontology (The Golden Tree) and a structured development lifecycle (ASDLC), we enable agents to build production-grade software with 100% reliability.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 🤖 For Agents

1.  **Initialize**: Read `.antigravity/BOOTLOADER.md` sequentially.
2.  **Verify**: Run `npm test` to ensure the Golden Tree is intact.

### 👤 For Humans

1.  **Clone**: Use this repository as the base for any new automation project.
2.  **Hydrate**: `npm install` all dependencies.
3.  **Vision**: Populate the `PRODUCT VISION` section in `AGENTS.md`.
4.  **Execute**: Watch as agents use the pre-crystallized **Skills** to build your vision.
